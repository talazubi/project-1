The following repository is for our Data Analytics Bootcamp Project 1, regarding the stroke prediction dataset. 
Hypothesis: Does smoking indicate the likelyhood of suffering a stroke?
Null Hypothesis: Smoking had no impact on the likelyhood of a stroke.

Smoking had no impact on likelyhood of suffering a stroke, regardless of currently or formerly smoking. With uneven subject counts for each catagory, as outlined in the first bar chart, a percentage of stroke sufferers was determined and used to calculate a p value.

pvalue=0.7600802031755473

Pvalue being over 0.05, the findings are not statistically significant and we will go with the Null Hypothesis, smoking as no impact on suffering a stroke.

The second bar chart documenting the percentage values displays how close the values are.
