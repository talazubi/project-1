# project-1 hypertension and heart disease impact on stroke
The following repository is for our Data Analytics Bootcamp Project 1, regarding the hypertension and heart disease impact on stroke
#explore the dataset
check individualâ€™s health status based on hypertension and heart disease and categorize into four types: healthy individuals who don't; individuals who only have hypertension; individuals who only have heart disease; individuals who have both hypertension and heart disease.
hypertension	heart_disease	Count
0	0	4273
1	0	393
0	1	185
1	1	58

We create a pie chart to visualize the health status distribution based on the conditions of hypertension and heart disease on the whole dataset
#analysis
Take a closer look from the dataset, we create the summary table to only count the stroke and no stroke for each health status. 

Based on above summary table we create a pie chart to study health status for individuals who had stroke. From the health status distribution for stroke chart we can see more than half of people who had stroke also suffer hypertension and heart disease (57.4% of stroke population), and only 5.3% of individuals who had stroke is healthy. 

Furthermore, we want to see the stroke status in each health status, and create a bar chart based on the stroke percentage for each group.
