The following repository is for our Data Analytics Bootcamp Project 1, regarding the stroke prediction dataset with visualizations created for the following research questions: Does higher age increase the risk of stroke? , How do different types of work (Private, Self-employed, Govt_job, Never _worked) affect stroke risk?(Visualization 1) and Does living in an urban or rural area affect stroke likelihood?(Visualization 1).



Does higher age increase the risk of stroke?




A bar chart that displays the stroke occurence between varying age groups. From age 51-60 we see an increase of 29 stroke occurrences when compared to the age group of 41-50. There is a gradual increase in stroke occurrences with a high of 71 in ages 71-80. This graph visually comfirms higher age does increase the risk of stroke occurrence.



A line graph that displays the stroke occurrences distributed by age group. Storke occurrences seem to increase significantly as people age , There is a sharp rise in strokes for people in the 51-60 age. The highest number of strokes occurs in the 71-80 age group.This suggests that older adults , particularly those in their 70s face the greatest risk.

A bar chart that illustrates the probability of stroke across diffrent age groups in percentages. We see a low probability in younger age groups and a gradual increase to middle age with a substantial rise in older age groups. From age 61 and onwards the probability begins to rise sharply with much higher risks seen in age groups 71-80 and 81-90. The highest stroke probability is found in the 81-90 age group but it is important to note  the population in this age group is lower compared to others.


How do different types of work (Private, Self-employed, Govt_job, Never _worked) affect stroke risk?(Visualization 1)

A bar graph shows the number of people in diffrent work types , categorized by stroke status. For goverment jobs , only 28 out of 628 had a stroke sugessting a relatively low stroke occurence amoung goverment employees but strokes still occur. For never worked , none experienced a stroke , this could be due to the limited sample size for this group. For private sector , 127 out of 2648 people had experienced a stoke , this group is the largest population but still indicates that it has a notable stroke occurence. For self employed , 53 out of 775 people have had a stroke sugessting that self employed individuals face unique risk factors related to stroke when compared to other work types.



Does living in an urban or rural area affect stroke likelihood?(Visualization 1)


A Pie chart displays the stroke occurrence between people living in urban and rual areas. Urban residence types have a slightly higher protion of stroke occurrences at 52.2% compared to rual residence types at 47.8%.The close distribution suggests that the occurrence of strokes is relatively balanced between urban and rual residence types.Potential reasons for the slight diffrece could be varying lifestyle factors , access to healthcare and enviromental conditions that are not captured in the dataset.
